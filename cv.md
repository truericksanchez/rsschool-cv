3. **My goal is to become a developer.** All my life I've been interested in computer science, but development has bypassed me. Computer science at school was an insanely uninteresting subject on which the teacher did not tell us anything useful, and in the end, I chose the path of the humanities. Now in my life came that turning point when I firmly decided to radically change it. I want to learn something new, meet interesting people, do things that I like. I need to bring real benefits and see the results of my work. **IT** can give me all of this. I am not a stupid person and i can learn easily and quickly. I'm patient, sociable and responsible, i have critical thinking. Every step, every turn on the path of life, every episode and statistical incredibility that brought me here helped me understand that *if you got a chance, you shouldn't stop.*
4. It's just basics knowledges, but I came here to up it cause i have skills in education:
* HTML, CSS, JS
* Git
* BEM
* Chrome DevTools
